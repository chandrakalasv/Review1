 The pseudocode for leap year or not is:

1) If the year is divisible evenly by 400, it is a leap year.
2) If the year is not divisible by 400, but is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
3) If the year is not divisible by 400, and also not divisible by 100, but is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
4) Else it's not a leap year.
